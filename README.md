# 🌿 Aether — A Branch-Structured Mobile Notes + Task App

> **Smart, structured, minimal.**  
> Aether is a mobile-first, folder-driven note and task manager — built for people who think in **branches**, not just lists.

---

## 📌 Overview

Aether is a **lightweight, mobile-first productivity app** designed for users who prefer to organize thoughts, media, and plans in a **folder-based, nested format** — unlike flat apps like Google Keep or overly complex tools like Notion.

It supports:
- **Folders and subfolders** for hierarchical organization
- **Notes**, **tasks**, and **images** inside any folder
- **Tags**, **dark mode**, and **offline-first experience**
- A calm, minimal interface with **future AI extensions**

---

## 🧠 Why Aether?

Most mainstream tools are either:
- **Too simple** (Google Keep: flat, unstructured),
- Or **too heavy** (Notion: bloated for basic use).

For users like me who track things like:
- `Anime → Title → Notes`
- `6th Sem → Subject → Chapter → Exam Tasks`
- `Ideas → Genre → Prompts`

...none of these apps offer **deep structuring**, **quick recall**, or **contextual nesting**.

**Aether is the missing middle-ground.**
