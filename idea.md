# 📘 Aether — Your Smart, Structured Note-Taking Companion

## 🌟 Overview

Aether is a revolutionary note-taking app born from a real need — the desire to organize thoughts, studies, and interests in a way that actually makes sense. It combines the simplicity of quick notes with the power of organized thinking, offering a perfect balance between flexibility and organization.

## 🎯 The Story Behind Aether

As a student and content enthusiast, I found myself constantly juggling between different note-taking apps, none of which quite hit the mark. I needed something that could handle:

- Organizing semester notes with proper hierarchy (Semester → Subjects → Chapters)
- Storing both handwritten notes (as images) and digital notes together
- Managing my anime/manga tracking with nested categories
- Keeping everything searchable and properly tagged

Existing solutions were either too simple (like flat-list note apps) or too complex (like full-blown productivity suites). That's when I decided to build Aether — the note-taking app I always wished I had.
