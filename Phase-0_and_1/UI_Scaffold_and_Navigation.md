# Phase 0 & 1 Documentation: UI Scaffold and Navigation

## 1. UI Scaffolding

-   **Core Screens:**
    -   `FolderListScreen`: Displays a list of note folders.
    -   `NoteListScreen`: Shows notes within a selected folder.
    -   `NoteDetailScreen`: For viewing and editing individual notes.
    -   `TaskListScreen`: Manages tasks (future implementation).
    -   `SettingsScreen`: Application settings.
    -   `SearchScreen`: For searching notes and tasks.

-   **Component Development:**
    -   Basic UI elements (buttons, input fields, lists) have been created or planned.
    -   Focus on reusability and modularity.

-   **Styling Approach:**
    -   Utilizing NativeWind for utility-first CSS (Tailwind CSS) to ensure a consistent and modern aesthetic across platforms.
    -   Aiming for a minimal, premium, modern SaaS look and feel.

## 2. Navigation Implementation

-   **React Navigation Setup:**
    -   Integrated `@react-navigation/native` as the core navigation library.
    -   Used `@react-navigation/stack` for stack-based navigation (e.g., Folder -> NoteList -> NoteDetail).
    -   Used `@react-navigation/bottom-tabs` for primary application navigation (Home, Search, Settings).

-   **Navigation Flows:**
    -   **Bottom Tab Navigator:**
        -   Home (FolderListScreen)
        -   Search (SearchScreen)
        -   Settings (SettingsScreen)
    -   **Stack Navigator (within Home tab):**
        -   FolderListScreen -> NoteListScreen -> NoteDetailScreen

## 3. State Management Integration (Initial)

-   **Zustand:**
    -   Initial setup of Zustand stores in the `state/` folder.
    -   Planned for managing application-wide state, such as theme preferences, user data, and note/task data.

## 4. Accomplishments in UI & Navigation

-   Successfully laid out static UI elements for all core screens.
-   Implemented the main navigation flows using React Navigation.
-   Established a foundation for state management with Zustand.
-   Applied initial styling using NativeWind, though full verification is pending due to the `tailwindConfigV3` error.

## 5. Pending Items & Next Steps

-   **Resolve `tailwindConfigV3` Error:** This is the most critical immediate next step to enable full styling capabilities.
-   **Full Functionality of Theme Toggle:** Implement the dark/light theme switching logic.
-   **UI/UX Refinement:** Iterate on the design based on feedback and testing.
-   **Component Development:** Build out more complex and interactive components.
-   **Zustand Integration:** Fully integrate Zustand for data persistence and complex state management.
-   **Testing:** Implement unit and integration tests for UI and navigation.
