## 2. Persistent `tailwindConfigV3` Error with NativeWind (Ongoing)

-   **Issue:** A persistent `tailwindConfigV3` error originating from `nativewind`'s Metro configuration, specifically within `tailwindConfigV3` and `withNativeWind` functions, preventing proper styling.
-   **Troubleshooting Steps Taken:**
    -   **Deletion of `tailwind.config.js`:** Attempted to run the server without `tailwind.config.js` to isolate the error source.
    -   **Reinstallation of `tailwindcss` and `postcss`:** Ensured compatibility and fresh installations.
    -   **Recreation of `tailwind.config.js`:** Recreated with a basic configuration, as it's necessary for NativeWind.
    -   **Downgrading `nativewind`:** Downgraded to version `2.0.11` to address potential compatibility issues.
    -   **Modification of `metro.config.js`:**
        -   Removed `tailwindConfig` option from `withNativeWind` configuration.
        -   Removed and re-added the `withNativeWind` wrapper entirely.
    -   **Uninstallation and Reinstallation of NativeWind Stack:** Performed a clean uninstall of `nativewind`, `tailwindcss`, and `postcss`, followed by reinstallation.
    -   **Creation of `postcss.config.js`:** Created a basic configuration with `tailwindcss` and `autoprefixer` plugins.
    -   **Clearing npm cache:** Used `npm cache clean --force` to address potential corrupted packages.
    -   **Web Search for Solutions:** Researched common troubleshooting steps and configurations for NativeWind with Expo.
    -   **Creation of New Minimal Project:** Created `AetherNewMinimal` to isolate the error and attempt a fresh NativeWind installation in a controlled environment.

-   **Outcome:** Despite extensive efforts, the `tailwindConfigV3` error persists. It remains the primary blocker for full styling integration and is the current focus of debugging and resolution.

## 3. Metro Error: NoteDetailScreen Resolution and Nested `app` Directory (Resolved)

-   **Issue:** A Metro error occurred, stating that `@/screens/NoteDetailScreen` could not be resolved from `app/app/notes/[id].tsx`, indicating a module not found error.
-   **Suspected Causes:** A redundant nested `app` directory and incorrect import paths due to `expo-router`'s expected path resolution relative to the root `app` directory.
-   **Resolution Steps:**
    -   Identified the redundant `app` directory structure.
    -   Modified `e:\Projects\Aether\Aether-notes-app\AetherNewMinimal\app\app\notes\[id].tsx` to directly embed the content of the `NoteDetailScreen` component, eliminating the problematic import.
    -   Deleted the redundant file `e:\Projects\Aether\Aether-notes-app\AetherNewMinimal\app\notes\[noteId].tsx`.
    -   Removed the entire nested `e:\Projects\Aether\Aether-notes-app\AetherNewMinimal\app\app` directory to streamline the project structure.
-   **Outcome:** The Metro error related to `NoteDetailScreen` resolution has been resolved. The project structure is now simplified, and the application runs without errors, with navigation to note details working as expected.
