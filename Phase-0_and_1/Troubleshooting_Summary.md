## 1. Blank White Screen on Web (Resolved)

-   **Issue:** Application displayed a blank white screen when run on the web platform.
-   **Suspected Causes:** Incorrect `main` entry point in `package.json`, dependency conflicts, Metro errors, unnecessary polyfills.
-   **Resolution Steps:**
    -   Updated `package.json` to remove unnecessary polyfills.
    -   Aligned `react` and `react-dom` versions to match a known working configuration.
    -   Ensured correct import paths in application files.
-   **Outcome:** The blank screen issue was resolved, and the web preview now displays correctly.

## 2. Persistent `tailwindConfigV3` Error with NativeWind (Ongoing)

-   **Issue:** A persistent `tailwindConfigV3` error originating from `nativewind`'s Metro configuration, specifically within `tailwindConfigV3` and `withNativeWind` functions, preventing proper styling.
-   **Troubleshooting Steps Taken:**
    -   **Deletion of `tailwind.config.js`:** Attempted to run the server without `tailwind.config.js` to isolate the error source.
    -   **Reinstallation of `tailwindcss` and `postcss`:** Ensured compatibility and fresh installations.
    -   **Recreation of `tailwind.config.js`:** Recreated with a basic configuration, as it's necessary for NativeWind.
    -   **Downgrading `nativewind`:** Downgraded to version `2.0.11` to address potential compatibility issues.
    -   **Modification of `metro.config.js`:**
        -   Removed `tailwindConfig` option from `withNativeWind` configuration.
        -   Removed and re-added the `withNativeWind` wrapper entirely.
    -   **Uninstallation and Reinstallation of NativeWind Stack:** Performed a clean uninstall of `nativewind`, `tailwindcss`, and `postcss`, followed by reinstallation.
    -   **Creation of `postcss.config.js`:** Created a basic configuration with `tailwindcss` and `autoprefixer` plugins.
    -   **Clearing npm cache:** Used `npm cache clean --force` to address potential corrupted packages.
    -   **Web Search for Solutions:** Researched common troubleshooting steps and configurations for NativeWind with Expo.
    -   **Creation of New Minimal Project:** Created `AetherNewMinimal` to isolate the error and attempt a fresh NativeWind installation in a controlled environment.

-   **Outcome:** Despite extensive efforts, the `tailwindConfigV3` error persists. It remains the primary blocker for full styling integration and is the current focus of debugging and resolution.

## 3. Metro Error: NoteDetailScreen Resolution and Nested `app` Directory (Resolved)

-   **Issue:** A Metro error occurred, stating that `@/screens/NoteDetailScreen` could not be resolved from `app/app/notes/[id].tsx`, indicating a module not found error.
-   **Suspected Causes:** A redundant nested `app` directory and incorrect import paths due to `expo-router`'s expected path resolution relative to the root `app` directory.
-   **Resolution Steps:**
    -   Identified the redundant `app` directory structure.
    -   Modified `e:\Projects\Aether\Aether-notes-app\AetherNewMinimal\app\app\notes\[id].tsx` to directly embed the content of the `NoteDetailScreen` component, eliminating the problematic import.
    -   Deleted the redundant file `e:\Projects\Aether\Aether-notes-app\AetherNewMinimal\app\notes\[noteId].tsx`.
    -   Removed the entire nested `e:\Projects\Aether\Aether-notes-app\AetherNewMinimal\app\app` directory to streamline the project structure.
-   **Outcome:** The Metro error related to `NoteDetailScreen` resolution has been resolved. The project structure is now simplified, and the application runs without errors, with navigation to note details working as expected.

# üöÄ Migration Notice (v1.1 ‚Üí v2.0)

## üõ†Ô∏è Migration from React Native to Flutter + Dart

As of version 2.0, this project has been migrated from React Native to Flutter + Dart.

This decision was made after careful consideration of the project's long-term maintainability, performance goals, and development roadmap.

## üîÑ Why the Migration?

Several factors contributed to this shift:

-   **Unified Tooling & Ecosystem:** Flutter provides a cohesive environment with first-party tooling (e.g., Flutter CLI, Hot Reload, Dart DevTools), making development more streamlined and consistent.

-   **Performance:** Flutter compiles directly to native ARM code, offering smoother animations and lower latency compared to React Native‚Äôs JavaScript bridge architecture.

-   **UI Consistency:** Flutter‚Äôs widget-based rendering ensures pixel-perfect UI across both iOS and Android without relying heavily on native components.

-   **Reduced Dependency Overhead:** React Native often depends on third-party libraries for essential functionality, leading to frequent version mismatches and compatibility issues.

-   **Long-Term Maintainability:** Flutter‚Äôs active community, robust documentation, and growing adoption across platforms (mobile, web, desktop) offer a more unified and future-proof approach.


## üìÅ Project Versioning

v1.1 and earlier: Built with React Native (JavaScript/TypeScript)

v2.0 and beyond: Built with Flutter (Dart)


Older versions are preserved in the repository under the `legacy/react-native` branch for reference and archival purposes.


---

## üí° Notes for Developers

The new Flutter codebase is structured following best practices including separation of concerns, state management (e.g., Provider, Riverpod, or Bloc depending on your choice), and platform-agnostic UI.

Documentation and contribution guidelines have been updated to reflect Flutter usage.

All core functionality from the React Native version has been re-evaluated and reimplemented to align with Flutter conventions.
