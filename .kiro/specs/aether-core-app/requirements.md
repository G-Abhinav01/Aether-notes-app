# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Aether is a mobile-first note and task management application built with Flutter and Dart, designed to provide structured organization through nested folders while maintaining simplicity and ease of use. The app addresses the gap between overly flat note-taking apps (like Google Keep) and overly complex structured apps (like Notion) by offering a file-system-like hierarchy with folders, subfolders, notes, tasks, and images. The core functionality focuses on creating, organizing, and managing content with intuitive navigation, search capabilities, and basic file operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Folder Structure and Navigation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create and navigate through nested folders so that I can organize my content hierarchically like a file system.

3. WHEN a user taps on a folder THEN the system SHALL navigate into that folder and display its contents
4. WHEN a user is inside a folder THEN the system SHALL allow creating subfolders with unlimited nesting depth
5. WHEN a user navigates through folders THEN the system SHALL provide clear breadcrumb navigation or back button functionality
6. WHEN a user is in any folder THEN the system SHALL display a floating action button (+) for creating new content

### Requirement 2: Content Creation and Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create different types of content (text notes, tasks, images) within folders so that I can store diverse information in an organized manner.

5. WHEN a user creates any content THEN the system SHALL automatically save changes and assign timestamps
6. WHEN a user opens existing content THEN the system SHALL load it for editing with all previous data intact

### Requirement 3: Bottom Navigation and Core Screens

**User Story:** As a user, I want easy access to different sections of the app so that I can quickly navigate between home, recent items, trash, and settings.

4. WHEN a user accesses sort options THEN the system SHALL provide sorting by name, date created, date modified, and type
5. WHEN a user applies a sort option THEN the system SHALL immediately reorder the displayed content accordingly
6. WHEN a user changes view or sort preferences THEN the system SHALL remember these settings for future sessions

### Requirement 5: Search Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want to search through my content with contextual scope so that I can quickly find specific folders, notes, or information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is on the home screen THEN the search SHALL include all folders, notes, tasks, and images throughout the entire app
2. WHEN a user is inside a specific folder THEN the search SHALL be scoped to that folder and all its subfolders
3. WHEN a user types a search query without "#" THEN the system SHALL search through file names and text content within notes
4. WHEN a user types "#" before their search query THEN the system SHALL search only through file and folder names
5. WHEN search results are displayed THEN the system SHALL show the item type, name, and folder path for context
6. WHEN a user taps a search result THEN the system SHALL navigate to that item's location and open it

### Requirement 6: Content Selection and Operations

5. WHEN theme changes are applied THEN the system SHALL immediately update the interface without requiring app restart
6. WHEN the app restarts THEN the system SHALL remember and apply the user's previously selected theme preference

### Requirement 8: Data Persistence and Basic Offline Support
