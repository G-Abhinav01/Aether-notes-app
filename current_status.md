# Project Status: Aether Notes App

## Current State

- **Project Initialization**: The `AetherNewMinimal` project has been successfully set up as a minimal Expo React Native application.
- **Dependency Installation**: All initial dependencies have been installed.
- **Babel Configuration**: The `babel.config.js` file has been created in the `AetherNewMinimal` directory with the Expo preset and NativeWind Babel plugin, resolving the `tailwindConfigV3` error.
- **Development Server**: The Expo development server (`npm start`) is running, and the Metro Bundler is active. The app is previewable at `http://localhost:8081`.
- **Core Folder Structure**: The `screens/`, `state/`, and `utils/` directories have been created within `AetherNewMinimal`.
- Implemented a basic home screen in `app/index.tsx` with a title, description, and corrected navigation links to "Notes" and "Folders" within the tab structure, including the `/app` prefix for routing.

## Next Steps

1.  **State Management**: Implement state management for notes (e.g., using Context API or Redux).
2.  **Theme and Styling**: Define a consistent theme and styling system for the application.
3.  **Screen Scaffolding**: Further develop the UI for `NotesScreen`, `NoteDetailScreen`, and `FolderListScreen`.
4.  **Data Persistence**: Implement local data persistence for notes (e.g., using `expo-sqlite` or `AsyncStorage`).
5.  **Folder Management**: Implement functionality for creating, editing, and deleting folders.
6.  **Search and Filter**: Add search and filter capabilities for notes.
7.  **User Interface Enhancements**: Improve the overall look and feel of the application.
