# Aether Notes App - Development Status

This document outlines the current progress on the Aether Notes App, focusing on Phase 0 (Pre-Build Foundation) and Phase 1 (UI Scaffold & Navigation).

## Phase 0: Pre-Build Foundation

**Goal:** Set up project structure, core screens, navigation, styling base, dark/light theme toggle, and initial GitHub repo.

### Accomplishments:

- **Project Setup:** A new React Native project named `Aether` has been created using Expo, and the minimal setup is complete and previewable.
- **Navigation:** React Navigation (Stack and Bottom Tab Navigators) has been integrated.
- **Styling:** NativeWind (Tailwind CSS for React Native) has been integrated, but is currently experiencing a persistent `tailwindConfigV3` error.
- **State Management:** Zustand has been set up in the `state/` folder (initial shell store).
- **Core Folders:** `screens/`, `components/`, `state/`, `assets/`, and `utils/` folders have been created.
- **Theming:** Basic dark theme has been implemented as default, with a toggle in `SettingsScreen` (though full functionality needs verification).
- **Screen Scaffolding:** Initial screens (`FolderListScreen`, `NoteListScreen`, `NoteDetailScreen`, `TaskListScreen`, `SettingsScreen`, `SearchScreen`) have been scaffolded.

### Pending/To Be Verified:

- Full functionality of the dark/light theme toggle.
- Resolution of the `tailwindConfigV3` error with NativeWind.
- Verification of screen navigation and transitions.
- Confirmation of the complete folder structure as per requirements.

## Phase 1: UI Scaffold & Navigation

**Goal:** Lay out all static UI screens: folder list, nested folder view, notes/tasks toggles, detail view, and settings.

### Accomplishments:

- **UI Layout:** Static UI elements for `FolderListScreen`, `NoteListScreen`, `NoteDetailScreen`, `TaskListScreen`, `SettingsScreen`, and `SearchScreen` have been laid out.
- **Navigation Flow:** Bottom Tab Navigator for Home (FolderList), Search, and Settings, and Stack Navigation for Folder → NoteList → NoteDetail have been implemented.
- **Styling Application:** Tailwind/NativeWind classes have been applied for initial styling, but their full effect is hindered by the `tailwindConfigV3` error.

### Pending/To Be Verified:

- Confirmation of all UI elements matching the design specifications.
- Ensuring consistent padding, font hierarchy, soft rounded corners, and dark-muted backgrounds across all screens.
- Verification that the layout feels responsive and smooth.
- Integration of placeholder images/icons in `assets/`.

## Overall Status:

The foundational setup and initial UI scaffolding are largely complete. However, the persistent `tailwindConfigV3` error with NativeWind is currently preventing full styling and verification of the UI. Once this is addressed, further refinement and implementation of logic (Phase 2) can proceed.
