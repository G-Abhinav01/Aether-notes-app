# Current Issues in Aether Notes App

This document outlines the ongoing issues encountered during the development of the Aether Notes App, primarily focusing on the persistent blank white screen on the web platform.

## 1. Persistent Blank White Screen on Web

**Issue:** The application displays a blank white screen when run on the web platform (`http://localhost:8081`). This issue has persisted despite multiple attempts to resolve it.

**Why it arose:**
- Initially, it was suspected to be an incorrect `main` entry point in `package.json`.
- Later, dependency conflicts, particularly with `react` and `react-dom` versions, were identified as potential causes.
- Most recently, a Metro error related to Babel (`.plugins` not a valid Plugin property in `node_modules\expo-router\entry.js` and `node_modules\expo-router\_error.js`) was observed, indicating a bundling failure.

**How we're dealing with it:**
- Verified and corrected `main` entry point in `package.json` to `expo-router/entry`.
- Cleared npm cache (`npm cache clean --force`) and reinstalled dependencies (`npm install`, `npm install --force`).
- Updated `react` and `react-dom` to version `19.0.0` in `package.json` and reinstalled dependencies.
- Deleted `web-build` directory to force a fresh web build.
- Performed a clean installation by deleting `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, followed by `npm install`.
- Reinstalled `expo-router` (`npm install expo-router@latest`).

**Current State:**
- Attempted to set `EXPO_ROUTER_IMPORT_MODE` environment variable to `react-native-web` to address web-specific bundling issues.
- Attempted to add `@babel/plugin-transform-export-namespace-from` to `babel.config.js` to address syntax errors.
- Corrected import paths in `app/notes/[folderId].tsx` and `app/notes/detail/[noteId].tsx`.
- The Expo server starts successfully, and the web preview URL is available.
- Blank screen on web build: The issue has been resolved in the `Aether` project by updating `package.json` to remove unnecessary polyfills and align `react` and `react-dom` versions with the working `test-router-app-new` project. The Expo server now starts successfully, and the web preview displays correctly.
