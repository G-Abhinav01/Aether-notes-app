# Current Issues in Aether Notes App

This document outlines the ongoing issues encountered during the development of the Aether Notes App, primarily focusing on the persistent blank white screen on the web platform.

## 1. Persistent Blank White Screen on Web

**Issue:** The primary issue is now a persistent `tailwindConfigV3` error with NativeWind, which prevents proper styling. The blank white screen issue on the web platform has been resolved.

**Why it arose:**
- Initially, it was suspected to be an incorrect `main` entry point in `package.json`.
- Later, dependency conflicts, particularly with `react` and `react-dom` versions, were identified as potential causes.
- Most recently, a Metro error related to Babel (`.plugins` not a valid Plugin property in `node_modules\expo-router\entry.js` and `node_modules\expo-router\_error.js`) was observed, indicating a bundling failure.

**How we're dealing with it:**
- Verified and corrected `main` entry point in `package.json` to `expo-router/entry`.
- Cleared npm cache (`npm cache clean --force`) and reinstalled dependencies (`npm install`, `npm install --force`).
- Updated `react` and `react-dom` to version `19.0.0` in `package.json` and reinstalled dependencies.
- Deleted `web-build` directory to force a fresh web build.
- Performed a clean installation by deleting `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, followed by `npm install`.
- Reinstalled `expo-router` (`npm install expo-router@latest`).

**Current State:**
- The blank screen issue on the web build has been resolved by updating `package.json` to remove unnecessary polyfills and align `react` and `react-dom` versions. The Expo server now starts successfully, and the web preview displays correctly.
- However, the `tailwindConfigV3` error persists, despite:
    - Updating and downgrading `nativewind`.
    - Modifying `metro.config.js` and `tailwind.config.js` configurations.
    - Reinstalling `tailwindcss` and `postcss`.
    - Clearing npm cache.
    - Creating `postcss.config.js`.
- A new minimal Expo project (`AetherNewMinimal`) has been created to isolate and troubleshoot the NativeWind issue.
